# Adding people
When you manage a course on SMC you might usually want to add students and collaborators.
When you manage a course on SMC you might usually want to add students and collaborators. In this section we'll add some students and collaborators to your project.

## Collaborators
The collaborators will more than likely be your demonstrators and any other lecturers in charge of the course. These can be added directly on the settings section of your project (wrench icon). Collaborators will have full access to all the project content by default.

## Students
Students are added directly from the `.course` file in home directory. If you have a very small group you can add these manually, otherwise you can copy the contents of a .xls or .csv file directly on the **Add student by name or email address** box.

## Exercise 2
We'll add "students" to the session: locate the `hands_on.csv` file (*in-person tutorial session only*, sorry) provided by the tutor and add your peers as students.

You can do this by copying and pasting directly from the file onto the box. Once they have been added, the students will receive an email inviting them to join the course. When doing this please encourage them to use their institutional email and real name for this account.

Alternatively, if the students already have a SMC account they can be found by
typing their name in the box.

As the students accept the invitation you will be able to see the students name and email  in your **.course** file. This also provides information on when they last accessed the project.

Once a student has been added to the project they have their own copy of the project, which is where they will be working on during the lectures.

**Also, note that the material will only be made available to students as you explicitly assign them.**
