# Grading and collecting assignments
In this section you will be able to collect and grade some assignments.

## Collecting assignments
In the previous section you assigned some coursework and shared materials with your peers.

After an assignment has been made, you will notice a **Collect** button next to it.

**Note:** If you click on this button you will generate a copy of the student's assignment in your own directory as well as the extra files (s)he might have generated.

## Grading
You can now open and mark the student's assignment. You can annotate the assignments as you please and the students will get a copy of everything you have added once you return the assignments.

A convenient way to annotate the assignments is to use the markdown cells and use HTML tags (e.g. to change the font colour).

```html
<font color ="red"> Great work! </font>
```
Once you are done you can return to the .project file and mark it by clicking in *Enter grade* and assign an appropriate mark.

## Returning an assignment
After grading an assignment click on the **Return** button and a copy of your modified file will be added to the student's project.

## Exercise 4: collect and grade assignments
Remember the assignments you assigned to your peers? Hopefully they will now include some modifications. Collect them and grade them. Once completed, return them to whoever it was assigned.

## Extra-exercise
Export the grades from your course work in either a .csv file or as a Python file.

(Hint: this is not done in your .course file but directly on the project Settings.)
